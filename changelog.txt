v1.0.1

    - Added automatic rejoining for channels we were in, after being
      disconnected. Added code to not reconnect after an Oper kills pIRC

v1.0.2

    - Fixed a bug with losing our channels/nicks/modes listing if we reload
      the bot (it was getting cleared)

v1.0.3

    - Removed pings/pongs from non-quiet logging, too much log spam. Also
      added a changelog file.
      
v1.0.4

    - ACTUALLY fixed the bug from 1.0.2 (the fix was flawed)
