pIRC (Perl IRC) is a client framework for those who want to code an
IRC bot and need somewhere to start. When completed this script will
handle the connection to an IRC server and all IRC client information.
The bot code will be put into bot.pm inside the modules directory and
all relevant information (messages, joins, invites, etc) will be passed
to that module for processing.
