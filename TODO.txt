TODO List for pIRC code
   
1. Handling of channel modes. This will be done in a new module modules::cmodes
   and will give bot developers access to channel modes and channel modes set
   on nicks. I'll add some code to simplify the use of this, so all someone
   needs to do is run CheckMode('channel', 'nick'); and this will return
   the modes set on that nick in that channel, or "no such nick" or "no such
   channel". If run with only the channel argument it will return the modes set
   on the channel, or no such channel. (You of course need to be in a channel
   to check its modes)
   
   
For after version 1.0:
   
1. Multiserver support. I will merge $host and $port, which will then be
   used like $server = 'irc.network1.org:9001,irc.network2.org:9002'
   in addition, I will expand all easysend subs to have a first argument
   for which network to send to, and also each sub for incoming data in
   the bot module will have a $network variable for which network it came
   from. A 'network' will be named as the middle of the domain, irc.blah.org
   would be known as $network = 'blah'.
   
2. Multithreading support. This would mean that all of the events that call
   subs in the bot module would be forked to a new thread, this way anything
   your bot module does isn't done in a queue sort of way (do this, then that,
   etc) but each task is done in a new thread, simultanously.
