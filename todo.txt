TODO List for pIRC code
   
   --
   
For after version 1.0.0 (MAYBE):
   
1. Multiserver support. I will merge $host and $port, which will then be
   used like $server = 'irc.network1.org:9001,irc.network2.org:9002'
   in addition, I will expand all easysend subs to have a first argument
   for which network to send to, and also each sub for incoming data in
   the bot module will have a $network variable for which network it came
   from. A 'network' will be named as the middle of the domain, irc.blah.org
   would be known as $network = 'blah'.
   
2. Multithreading support. This would mean that all of the events that call
   subs in the bot module would be forked to a new thread, this way anything
   your bot module does isn't done in a queue sort of way (do this, then that,
   etc) but each task is done in a new thread, simultanously.
